# k8s-web-app
We will be creating a very simple web application using the popular python web framework, Django that can interact with your kubernetes cluster.

Most of the _refresh_ steps in the blog, appear between modifications, meaning that once you complete the step, the page will not be rendered since the project will fail. In that case, my recomendation is to keep forward with the next steps and then check your terminal output to see if the server is still up.
